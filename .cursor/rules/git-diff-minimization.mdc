Please make only the necessary inline changes to accomplish this task without reformatting or displacing surrounding code. I need to keep my git diffs minimal.

When editing, please use this format for your changes:
1. Identify exact line numbers needing modification
2. Show only the specific changes required (not entire functions)
3. Keep existing indentation and formatting

When making changes:
- Do not reformat entire functions
- Maintain existing indentation style
- Do not adjust blank lines or spacing
- Do not rearrange imports or declarations
